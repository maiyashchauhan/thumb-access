## 🔍 Overview
This project is a **frontend-only prototype** that simulates an Aadhaar-based login process. It allows users to enter their **name** and **date of birth**, simulate a **fingerprint scan**, receive a **fake OTP**, and view a **successful login** message.

No real Aadhaar data, biometric verification, or backend services are used. This is strictly a **UI/UX demonstration** for educational or concept purposes.

## 🧩 Features
- Name and Date of Birth input fields
- Preset fingerprint drawing (no hardware required)
- Optional **"Verify (Skip Fingerprint)"** button for devices without sensors
- Simulated fingerprint verification animation
- Fake OTP generation and verification
- Clean and responsive interface with a 3-step flow:
  1. Login Page — Enter details and verify fingerprint
  2. OTP Page — Receive and enter fake OTP
  3. Success Page — See confirmation message
